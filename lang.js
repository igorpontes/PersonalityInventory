	'titulo-ver-realizacao-neo':'Realization NEO',
	'label-conteudo-realizacao':'<b>Realization</b> - Realization is the way in which we control, regulate and direct our impulses. Impulses are not inherently bad, sometimes time constraints require a snap decision and act on our first impulse can be an effective response. Moreover, in times of distraction rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be fun. Impulsive individuals may be seen by others as colorful, fun and clowns. However, by acting impulse can lead to problems in a number of ways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts not only harm other members of society, but also can result in punishment for the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another problem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate rewards but undesirable consequences in the long term. Examples include excessive socialization that leads to being fired from a job, throw an insult that causes the end of an important relationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually destroy sa&uacute;de.O impulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes the effectiveness of a person in significant ways. Lets not act impulsively contemplate alternative courses of action, some of which would have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also diverts people during projects that require sequences of steps or stages organized. The achievements of an impulsive person are therefore small, scattered and inconsistent. The benefits are obvious high-Realization. Individuals filmmakers avoid problems and achieve high levels of success through purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively regarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics.

	'titulo-ver-neuroticismo-neo':'Neuroticism NEO',
	'label-conteudo-neuroticismo':'<b>Neuroticism</b> - Freud originally used the term neurosis to describe a condition marked by mental anguish, emotional distress and an inability to deal effectively with the normal demands of life. He suggested that everyone shows some signs of neurosis, but that we differ in our degree of suffering and our specific symptoms of distress. Today, Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings. Those with high scores on Neuroticism may experience primarily one specific negative feeling such as anxiety, anger or depression, but are likely to experience several of these emotions. People with high scores on Neuroticism are emotionally reactive. They respond emotionally to events that would not affect most people, and their reactions tend to be more intense than normal. They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for an unusually long period of time, which means they are often in a bad mood. These problems with emotional regulation can diminish a neurotic\'s ability to think clearly, make decisions and deal effectively with stress. At the other end of the scale, individuals with low scores in Neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable and free from persistent negative feelings. Be more free from negative feelings does not mean that people with low scores to experience many positive feelings, the frequency of positive emotions is a component of the Extraversion domain.<br><b>Facets of Neuroticism:</b><br><b>Anxiety</b> - The system of "fight or flight" of the brain of anxious individuals is too easily and often compromised.

However, the Intellect is probably best seen as one aspect of the opening. Opening scores are only modestly related to years of schooling and scores on standardized tests of intelligence. Another feature of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience. Depending on the individual\'s specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic cognition may take the form of mathematical thinking, logical or geometric, artistic and metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of many visual art and performance. People with low scores on Openness tend to have narrow interests and common. They prefer simple, straightforward and obvious to the subtle, complex and ambiguous. They can see the arts and sciences with suspicion, considering these efforts confusing and of no practical use. People closed prefer familiarity to novelty, are conservative and resistant to change. The opening is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, who are often themselves open to experience. However, the open and closed styles are thought useful in different environments. The intellectual style of the open person may serve a professor well, but research has shown that closed thinking is related to superior performance in police work, a variety of sales and service occupations.<br><b>Facets of Opening:</b><br><b>Imagination</b> - To imaginative individuals, the real world is often too plain and simple. People with high scores on this scale use fantasy as a way of creating a world richer, more interesting.<br><b>Artistic Interests</b> - They become easily involved and absorbed in artistic and natural events.

Intelligent activity involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning routes to these goals, objectives and persistence in spite of short pulses to the contrary.

Em grupos, eles gostam de falar, afirmar-se e chamar a aten&ccedil;&atilde;o para si. Aos introvertidos, falta a exuber&acirc;ncia, energia e os n&iacute;veis de atividade dos extrovertidos. Introvertidos tendem a ser silenciosos, discretos, ponderados e desengajados do mundo social.

Eles s&atilde;o, portanto, atenciosos, simp&aacute;ticos, generosos, prestativos e dispostos a comprometer os seus interesses com os dos outros. Pessoas soci&aacute;veis tamb&eacute;m t&ecirc;m uma vis&atilde;o otimista da natureza humana. Elas acreditam que as pessoas s&atilde;o, basicamente, honestas, decentes e dignas de confian&ccedil;a. Indiv&iacute;duos n&atilde;o-soci&aacute;veis colocam o interesse pr&oacute;prio acima da conviv&ecirc;ncia com os outros. Eles s&atilde;o geralmente despreocupados com o bem-estar dos outros e, portanto, &eacute; improv&aacute;vel que se ofere&ccedil;am para outras pessoas. &Agrave;s vezes, seu ceticismo sobre as motiva&ccedil;&otilde;es dos outros faz com que sejam suspeitos, hostis, e n&atilde;o-cooperativos.

	'label-conteudo-realizacao':'<b>Realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o</b> - A Realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o trata da maneira pela qual n&oacute;s controlamos, regulamos e direcionamos os nossos impulsos. Os impulsos n&atilde;o s&atilde;o inerentemente maus; &agrave;s vezes restri&ccedil;&otilde;es de tempo requerem uma decis&atilde;o precipitada e agir em nosso primeiro impulso pode ser uma resposta eficaz. Al&eacute;m disso, nas horas de distra&ccedil;&atilde;o ao inv&eacute;s de trabalho, atuar de forma espont&acirc;nea e impulsiva pode ser divertido. Indiv&iacute;duos impulsivos podem ser vistos pelos outros como pitorescos, divertidos e palha&ccedil;os. N&atilde;o obstante, agir por impulso pode levar a problemas em uma s&eacute;rie de maneiras. Alguns impulsos s&atilde;o anti-sociais. Atos anti-sociais descontrolados n&atilde;o s&oacute; prejudicam outros membros da sociedade, como tamb&eacute;m podem resultar em puni&ccedil;&atilde;o para o autor de tais atos impulsivos. Outro problema com os atos impulsivos &eacute; que muitas vezes eles produzem recompensas imediatas, mas conseq&uuml;&ecirc;ncias indesej&aacute;veis em longo prazo. Exemplos incluem excesso de Socializa&ccedil;&atilde;o que leva a ser demitido de um emprego, lan&ccedil;ar um insulto que provoca o t&eacute;rmino de um relacionamento importante, ou utilizar drogas indutoras de prazer que, eventualmente, destroem a sa&uacute;de.O comportamento impulsivo, mesmo quando n&atilde;o seriamente destrutivo, diminui a efic&aacute;cia de uma pessoa de maneiras significativas. Agir impulsivamente n&atilde;o permite contemplar cursos alternativos de a&ccedil;&atilde;o, alguns dos quais teriam sido mais s&aacute;bios do que a escolha impulsiva. A impulsividade tamb&eacute;m desvia as pessoas durante projetos que requerem seq&uuml;&ecirc;ncias de etapas ou est&aacute;gios organizados. As realiza&ccedil;&otilde;es de uma pessoa impulsiva s&atilde;o, portanto, pequenas, dispersas e inconsistentes. Os benef&iacute;cios de alta Realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o s&atilde;o &oacute;bvios. Indiv&iacute;duos realizadores evitam problemas e alcan&ccedil;am altos n&iacute;veis de sucesso atrav&eacute;s de planejamento e persist&ecirc;ncia propositais. Eles tamb&eacute;m s&atilde;o positivamente considerados por outros como inteligentes e confi&aacute;veis. Do lado negativo, eles podem ser perfeccionistas compulsivo e workaholics. Al&eacute;m disso, indiv&iacute;duos extremamente realizadores podem ser considerados enfadonhos e entediantes. Pessoas n&atilde;o-realizadoras podem ser criticadas por sua n&atilde;o-confiabilidade, falta de ambi&ccedil;&atilde;o, e por n&atilde;o ficar dentro das linhas, mas v&atilde;o experimentar muitos prazeres breves e nunca ser&atilde;o chamados de enfadonhos.<br><b>Facetas da Realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o:</b><br><b>Auto-efic&aacute;cia</b> - A auto-efic&aacute;cia descreve a confian&ccedil;a na pr&oacute;pria capacidade de realizar coisas.

Elas mant&ecirc;m listas e fazem planos.<br><b>Senso de dever</b> - Esta escala reflete a for&ccedil;a do senso de dever e obriga&ccedil;&atilde;o de uma pessoa.

Seus esfor&ccedil;os para serem reconhecidos como bem sucedidos os mant&ecirc;m na linha em dire&ccedil;&atilde;o a objetivos elevados. Eles geralmente t&ecirc;m um forte senso de dire&ccedil;&atilde;o na vida, mas escores extremamente altos podem ser exageradamente focados e obcecados com seu trabalho.<br><b>Autodisciplina</b> - A autodisciplina, que muitos chamam de for&ccedil;a de vontade, refere-se &agrave; capacidade de persistir em tarefas dif&iacute;ceis ou desagrad&aacute;veis at&eacute; que sejam conclu&iacute;das.<br><b>Prud&ecirc;ncia</b> - A prud&ecirc;ncia descreve a disposi&ccedil;&atilde;o para pensar nas possibilidades antes de agir.

	'titulo-ver-neuroticismo-neo':'Neuroticismo NEO',
	'label-conteudo-neuroticismo':'<b>Neuroticismo</b> - Freud originalmente utilizava o termo neurose para descrever uma condi&ccedil;&atilde;o marcada por uma ang&uacute;stia mental, sofrimento emocional e uma incapacidade de lidar eficazmente com as exig&ecirc;ncias normais da vida. Ele sugeriu que todos mostram alguns sinais de neurose, mas que nos diferenciamos em nosso grau de sofrimento e em nossos sintomas espec&iacute;ficos de ang&uacute;stia. Hoje, o Neuroticismo refere-se &agrave; tend&ecirc;ncia a experimentar sentimentos negativos. Aqueles com escores altos em Neuroticismo podem experimentar principalmente um sentimento negativo espec&iacute;fico, como ansiedade, raiva ou depress&atilde;o, mas s&atilde;o suscet&iacute;veis a experimentar v&aacute;rias dessas emo&ccedil;&otilde;es. Pessoas com escores altos em Neuroticismo s&atilde;o emocionalmente reativas. Elas respondem emocionalmente a eventos que n&atilde;o afetariam a maioria das pessoas, e suas rea&ccedil;&otilde;es tendem a ser mais intensas que o normal. Elas s&atilde;o mais propensas a interpretar situa&ccedil;&otilde;es comuns como amea&ccedil;as, e frustra&ccedil;&otilde;es menores como irremediavelmente dif&iacute;ceis. Suas rea&ccedil;&otilde;es emocionais negativas tendem a persistir por um per&iacute;odo excepcionalmente longo de tempo, o que significa que est&atilde;o frequentemente de mau humor. Esses problemas com regula&ccedil;&atilde;o emocional podem diminuir a capacidade de um neur&oacute;tico de pensar claramente, tomar decis&otilde;es e lidar eficientemente com o stress. No outro extremo da escala, os indiv&iacute;duos com baixos escores em Neuroticismo ficam menos facilmente chateados e s&atilde;o menos reativos emocionalmente. Eles tendem a ser calmos, emocionalmente est&aacute;veis e livre de sentimentos negativos persistentes. Estar mais livres de sentimentos negativos n&atilde;o significa que pessoas com baixos escores experimentem muitos sentimentos positivos; a freq&uuml;&ecirc;ncia de emo&ccedil;&otilde;es positivas &eacute; um componente do dom&iacute;nio Extrovers&atilde;o.<br><b>Facetas do Neuroticismo:</b><br><b>Ansiedade</b> - O sistema de "luta ou fuga" do c&eacute;rebro de indiv&iacute;duos ansiosos &eacute; muito facilmente e geralmente comprometido. Portanto, pessoas com escores altos em ansiedade muitas vezes sentem que algo perigoso est&aacute; para acontecer.<br><b>Raiva</b> - Pessoas com escores altos em raiva sentem raiva quando as coisas n&atilde;o v&atilde;o do seu jeito. Elas s&atilde;o sens&iacute;veis sobre serem tratadas de forma justa e ficam ressentidas e amarguradas quando sentem que est&atilde;o sendo enganadas.<br><b>Depress&atilde;o</b> - Esta escala mede a tend&ecirc;ncia a se sentir triste, deprimido e desencorajado. Pessoas com escores altos se sentem com falta de energia e t&ecirc;m dificuldade de iniciar atividades.<br><b>Auto-percep&ccedil;&atilde;o</b> - Indiv&iacute;duos auto-perceptivos s&atilde;o sens&iacute;veis sobre o que os outros pensam deles. Sua preocupa&ccedil;&atilde;o com a rejei&ccedil;&atilde;o e o rid&iacute;culo faz com que eles se sintam t&iacute;midos e desconfort&aacute;veis ao redor de outros. Eles sentem-se facilmente constrangidos e muitas vezes envergonhados. Seus medos de que os outros v&atilde;o critic&aacute;-los ou tirar sarro deles s&atilde;o exagerados e irreais, mas a sua estranheza e desconforto podem tornar esses medos uma profecia auto-realiz&aacute;vel.<br><b>Falta de modera&ccedil;&atilde;o</b> - Indiv&iacute;duos n&atilde;o-moderados sentem fortes desejos e &acirc;nsias aos quais eles t&ecirc;m dificuldade em resistir. Tendem a ser orientados para os prazeres e recompensas de curto prazo, ao inv&eacute;s de consequ&ecirc;ncias em longo prazo.<br><b>Vulnerabilidade</b> - Pessoas com escores altos em vulnerabilidade experimentam p&acirc;nico, confus&atilde;o e desespero quando sob press&atilde;o ou estresse.',
	'titulo-ver-abertura-neo':'Abertura NEO',
	'label-conteudo-abertura':'<b>Abertura</b> - Abertura descreve uma dimens&atilde;o de estilo cognitivo que distingue entre indiv&iacute;duos imaginativos e criativos e aqueles p&eacute;-no-ch&atilde;o, convencionais. Pessoas abertas s&atilde;o intelectualmente curiosas, apreciam a arte e s&atilde;o sens&iacute;veis &agrave; beleza. Eles tendem a ser, comparados &agrave;s pessoas fechadas, mais conscientes de seus sentimentos. Tendem a pensar e agir de forma individualista e n&atilde;o-conformista. Intelectuais normalmente pontuam alto em Abertura; conseq&uuml;entemente, esse fator tamb&eacute;m tem sido chamado de Cultura ou Intelecto. N&atilde;o obstante, o Intelecto &eacute; provavelmente melhor considerado como um aspecto da Abertura. Escores em Abertura s&atilde;o apenas modestamente relacionados com os anos de escolaridade e os escores em testes padr&otilde;es de intelig&ecirc;ncia. Outra caracter&iacute;stica do estilo cognitivo aberto &eacute; uma facilidade para pensar em s&iacute;mbolos e abstra&ccedil;&otilde;es distantes da experi&ecirc;ncia concreta. Dependendo das habilidades intelectuais espec&iacute;ficas do indiv&iacute;duo, essa cogni&ccedil;&atilde;o simb&oacute;lica pode assumir a forma de pensamento matem&aacute;tico, l&oacute;gico ou geom&eacute;trico, uso art&iacute;stico e metaf&oacute;rico da linguagem, composi&ccedil;&atilde;o ou performance musical, ou uma das muitas artes visuais e de performance. Pessoas com baixos escores em Abertura tendem a ter interesses limitados e comuns. Elas preferem o simples, direto e &oacute;bvio ao sutil, complexo e amb&iacute;guo. Podem enxergam as artes e ci&ecirc;ncias com desconfian&ccedil;a, considerando estes esfor&ccedil;os confusos e de nenhum uso pr&aacute;tico. Pessoas fechadas preferem a familiaridade &agrave; novidade, s&atilde;o conservadoras e resistentes &agrave; mudan&ccedil;a. A Abertura &eacute; muitas vezes apresentada como mais saud&aacute;vel ou mais madura por psic&oacute;logos, que s&atilde;o muitas vezes eles mesmos abertos &agrave; experi&ecirc;ncia. No entanto, os estilos aberto e fechado de pensamento s&atilde;o &uacute;teis em ambientes diferentes. O estilo intelectual da pessoa aberta pode servir bem a um professor, mas pesquisas t&ecirc;m demonstrado que o pensamento fechado est&aacute; relacionado a um desempenho superior nos trabalhos de policial, vendas e uma variedade de ocupa&ccedil;&otilde;es de servi&ccedil;o.<br><b>Facetas da Abertura:</b><br><b>Imagina&ccedil;&atilde;o</b> - Para os indiv&iacute;duos imaginativos, o mundo real &eacute; muitas vezes demasiado simples e comum. Pessoas com escores altos nesta escala usam a fantasia como forma de criar um mundo mais rico, mais interessante.<br><b>Interesses art&iacute;sticos</b> - Tornam-se facilmente envolvidas e absorvidas em eventos art&iacute;sticos e naturais. Elas n&atilde;o s&atilde;o, necessariamente, treinadas artisticamente ou talentosas, embora muitas sejam. As caracter&iacute;sticas que definem esta escala s&atilde;o o interesse e a aprecia&ccedil;&atilde;o da beleza natural e artificial.<br><b>Emotividade</b> - Pessoas com alta Emotividade t&ecirc;m um bom acesso aos e consci&ecirc;ncia dos seus pr&oacute;prios sentimentos. Pessoas com baixos escores s&atilde;o menos conscientes dos seus sentimentos e tendem a n&atilde;o expressar suas emo&ccedil;&otilde;es abertamente.<br><b>Senso aventureiro</b> - Pessoas com escores altos em senso aventureiro s&atilde;o ansiosas para experimentar atividades novas, viajar por terras estrangeiras e provar coisas diferentes. Eles acham a familiaridade e a rotina chatas, e ir&atilde;o fazer um caminho para casa s&oacute; porque ele &eacute; diferente.<br><b>Intelecto</b> - O intelecto e os interesses art&iacute;sticos s&atilde;o os dois aspectos mais importantes e centrais da Abertura. Pessoas com escores altos em Intelecto gostam de brincar com id&eacute;ias. Elas t&ecirc;m a mente aberta a ideias novas e inusitadas, e gostam de debater quest&otilde;es intelectuais. Elas gostam de charadas, enigmas e quebra-cabe&ccedil;as.<br><b>Liberalismo</b> - O liberalismo psicol&oacute;gico refere-se &agrave; vontade de desafiar a autoridade, a conven&ccedil;&atilde;o e os valores tradicionais. Em sua forma mais extrema, o liberalismo psicol&oacute;gico pode at&eacute; representar hostilidade para com as regras, simpatia por infratores e amor &agrave; ambiguidade, ao caos e &agrave; desordem. Conservadores psicol&oacute;gicos preferem a seguran&ccedil;a e a estabilidade trazidas pela conformidade com a tradi&ccedil;&atilde;o. O liberalismo e o conservadorismo psicol&oacute;gicos n&atilde;o s&atilde;o id&ecirc;nticos &agrave; filia&ccedil;&atilde;o partid&aacute;ria, mas certamente predisp&otilde;em as pessoas a determinados partidos pol&iacute;ticos.',

Extrovertidos gostam de estar com as pessoas, s&atilde;o cheios de energia e muitas vezes experimentam emo&ccedil;&otilde;es positivas. Eles tendem a ser entusiastas, orientados para a a&ccedil;&atilde;o, indiv&iacute;duos que s&atilde;o propensos a dizer &ldquo;Sim!&rdquo; ou &ldquo;Vamos!&rdquo; &agrave;s oportunidades de excita&ccedil;&atilde;o. Em grupos, eles gostam de falar, afirmar-se e chamar a aten&ccedil;&atilde;o para si. Aos introvertidos, falta a exuber&acirc;ncia, energia e os n&iacute;veis de atividade dos extrovertidos. Introvertidos tendem a ser silenciosos, discretos, ponderados e desengajados do mundo social. A sua falta de participa&ccedil;&atilde;o social n&atilde;o deve ser interpretada como timidez ou depress&atilde;o; o introvertido simplesmente precisa de menos estimula&ccedil;&atilde;o do que um extrovertido e prefere ficar sozinho. A independ&ecirc;ncia e reserva do introvertido &eacute; por vezes confundida com hostilidade ou arrog&acirc;ncia. Na verdade, um introvertido que pontua alto na dimens&atilde;o Socializa&ccedil;&atilde;o n&atilde;o procurar&aacute; outras pessoas, mas ser&aacute; bastante agrad&aacute;vel quando abordado.',
	'titulo-realizacao-tipi':'Realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o TIPI',
	'label-conteudo-realizacao-tipi':'A Realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o trata da maneira pela qual n&oacute;s controlamos, regulamos e direcionamos os nossos impulsos. Os impulsos n&atilde;o s&atilde;o inerentemente maus; &agrave;s vezes restri&ccedil;&otilde;es de tempo requerem uma decis&atilde;o precipitada e agir em nosso primeiro impulso pode ser uma resposta eficaz. Al&eacute;m disso, nas horas de distra&ccedil;&atilde;o ao inv&eacute;s de trabalho, atuar de forma espont&acirc;nea e impulsiva pode ser divertido. Indiv&iacute;duos impulsivos podem ser vistos pelos outros como pitorescos, divertidos e palha&ccedil;os. N&atilde;o obstante, agir por impulso pode levar a problemas em uma s&eacute;rie de maneiras. Alguns impulsos s&atilde;o anti-sociais. Atos anti-sociais descontrolados n&atilde;o s&oacute; prejudicam outros membros da sociedade, como tamb&eacute;m podem resultar em puni&ccedil;&atilde;o para o autor de tais atos impulsivos. Outro problema com os atos impulsivos &eacute; que muitas vezes eles produzem recompensas imediatas, mas conseq&uuml;&ecirc;ncias indesej&aacute;veis em longo prazo. Exemplos incluem excesso de Socializa&ccedil;&atilde;o que leva a ser demitido de um emprego, lan&ccedil;ar um insulto que provoca o t&eacute;rmino de um relacionamento importante, ou utilizar drogas indutoras de prazer que, eventualmente, destroem a sa&uacute;de.O comportamento impulsivo, mesmo quando n&atilde;o seriamente destrutivo, diminui a efic&aacute;cia de uma pessoa de maneiras significativas. Agir impulsivamente n&atilde;o permite contemplar cursos alternativos de a&ccedil;&atilde;o, alguns dos quais teriam sido mais s&aacute;bios do que a escolha impulsiva. A impulsividade tamb&eacute;m desvia as pessoas durante projetos que requerem seq&uuml;&ecirc;ncias de etapas ou est&aacute;gios organizados. As realiza&ccedil;&otilde;es de uma pessoa impulsiva s&atilde;o, portanto, pequenas, dispersas e inconsistentes. Uma caracter&iacute;stica da intelig&ecirc;ncia, que potencialmente separa os seres humanos de formas de vida anteriores, &eacute; a capacidade de pensar sobre conseq&uuml;&ecirc;ncias futuras antes de agir por impulso. A atividade inteligente envolve contempla&ccedil;&atilde;o de objetivos de longo alcance, organiza&ccedil;&atilde;o e planejamento de rotas para esses objetivos, e persist&ecirc;ncia nos objetivos apesar dos impulsos de curta dura&ccedil;&atilde;o em contr&aacute;rio. A id&eacute;ia de que a intelig&ecirc;ncia envolve o controle dos impulsos &eacute; bem captada pelo termo prud&ecirc;ncia, um r&oacute;tulo alternativo para o dom&iacute;nio de Realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o. Prudente significa tanto s&aacute;bio quando cauteloso. Pessoas com escores altos na escala de Realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o s&atilde;o, de fato, percebidas pelos outros como inteligentes. Os benef&iacute;cios de alta Realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o s&atilde;o &oacute;bvios. Indiv&iacute;duos realizadores evitam problemas e alcan&ccedil;am altos n&iacute;veis de sucesso atrav&eacute;s de planejamento e persist&ecirc;ncia propositais. Eles tamb&eacute;m s&atilde;o positivamente considerados por outros como inteligentes e confi&aacute;veis. Do lado negativo, eles podem ser perfeccionistas compulsivo e workaholics. Al&eacute;m disso, indiv&iacute;duos extremamente realizadores podem ser considerados enfadonhos e entediantes. Pessoas n&atilde;o-realizadoras podem ser criticadas por sua n&atilde;o-confiabilidade, falta de ambi&ccedil;&atilde;o, e por n&atilde;o ficar dentro das linhas, mas v&atilde;o experimentar muitos prazeres breves e nunca ser&atilde;o chamados de enfadonhos.',
	'titulo-estabilidade-emocional-tipi':'Estabilidade Emocional',
	'label-conteudo-estabilidade-emocional-tipi':'A Estabilidade Emocional &eacute; o grande dom&iacute;nio da personalidade que se encontra no extremo oposto ao tra&ccedil;o de Neuroticismo. Freud originalmente utilizava o termo neurose para descrever uma condi&ccedil;&atilde;o marcada por uma ang&uacute;stia mental, sofrimento emocional e uma incapacidade de lidar eficazmente com as exig&ecirc;ncias normais da vida. Ele sugeriu que todos mostram alguns sinais de neurose, mas que nos diferenciamos em nosso grau de sofrimento e em nossos sintomas espec&iacute;ficos de ang&uacute;stia. Hoje, o Neuroticismo refere-se &agrave; tend&ecirc;ncia a experimentar sentimentos negativos. Os indiv&iacute;duos com altos escores em Estabilidade Emocional ficam menos facilmente chateados e s&atilde;o menos reativos emocionalmente. Eles tendem a ser calmos, emocionalmente est&aacute;veis e livre de sentimentos negativos persistentes. Estar mais livres de sentimentos negativos n&atilde;o significa que pessoas com altos escores experimentem muitos sentimentos positivos; a freq&uuml;&ecirc;ncia de emo&ccedil;&otilde;es positivas &eacute; um componente do dom&iacute;nio Extrovers&atilde;o. Aqueles com escores baixos em Estabilidade Emocional podem experimentar principalmente um sentimento negativo espec&iacute;fico, como ansiedade, raiva ou depress&atilde;o, mas s&atilde;o suscet&iacute;veis a experimentar v&aacute;rias dessas emo&ccedil;&otilde;es. Pessoas com escores baixos nesse dom&iacute;nio s&atilde;o emocionalmente reativas. Elas respondem emocionalmente a eventos que n&atilde;o afetariam a maioria das pessoas, e suas rea&ccedil;&otilde;es tendem a ser mais intensas que o normal. Elas s&atilde;o mais propensas a interpretar situa&ccedil;&otilde;es comuns como amea&ccedil;as, e frustra&ccedil;&otilde;es menores como irremediavelmente dif&iacute;ceis. Suas rea&ccedil;&otilde;es emocionais negativas tendem a persistir por um per&iacute;odo excepcionalmente longo de tempo, o que significa que est&atilde;o frequentemente de mau humor. Esses problemas com regula&ccedil;&atilde;o emocional podem diminuir a capacidade de um neur&oacute;tico de pensar claramente, tomar decis&otilde;es e lidar eficientemente com o estresse.',

	'titulo-abertura-tipi':'Abertura TIPI',
	'label-conteudo-abertura-tipi':'Abertura descreve uma dimens&atilde;o de estilo cognitivo que distingue entre indiv&iacute;duos imaginativos e criativos e aqueles p&eacute;-no-ch&atilde;o, convencionais. Pessoas abertas s&atilde;o intelectualmente curiosas, apreciam a arte e s&atilde;o sens&iacute;veis &agrave; beleza. Eles tendem a ser, comparados &agrave;s pessoas fechadas, mais conscientes de seus sentimentos. Tendem a pensar e agir de forma individualista e n&atilde;o-conformista. Intelectuais normalmente pontuam alto em Abertura; conseq&uuml;entemente, esse fator tamb&eacute;m tem sido chamado de Cultura ou Intelecto. N&atilde;o obstante, o Intelecto &eacute; provavelmente melhor considerado como um aspecto da Abertura. Escores em Abertura s&atilde;o apenas modestamente relacionados com os anos de escolaridade e os escores em testes padr&otilde;es de intelig&ecirc;ncia. Outra caracter&iacute;stica do estilo cognitivo aberto &eacute; uma facilidade para pensar em s&iacute;mbolos e abstra&ccedil;&otilde;es distantes da experi&ecirc;ncia concreta. Dependendo das habilidades intelectuais espec&iacute;ficas do indiv&iacute;duo, essa cogni&ccedil;&atilde;o simb&oacute;lica pode assumir a forma de pensamento matem&aacute;tico, l&oacute;gico ou geom&eacute;trico, uso art&iacute;stico e metaf&oacute;rico da linguagem, composi&ccedil;&atilde;o ou performance musical, ou uma das muitas artes visuais e de performance. Pessoas com baixos escores em Abertura tendem a ter interesses limitados e comuns. Elas preferem o simples, direto e &oacute;bvio ao sutil, complexo e amb&iacute;guo. Podem enxergam as artes e ci&ecirc;ncias com desconfian&ccedil;a, considerando estes esfor&ccedil;os confusos e de nenhum uso pr&aacute;tico. Pessoas fechadas preferem a familiaridade &agrave; novidade, s&atilde;o conservadoras e resistentes &agrave; mudan&ccedil;a. A Abertura &eacute; muitas vezes apresentada como mais saud&aacute;vel ou mais madura por psic&oacute;logos, que s&atilde;o muitas vezes eles mesmos abertos &agrave; experi&ecirc;ncia. No entanto, os estilos aberto e fechado de pensamento s&atilde;o &uacute;teis em ambientes diferentes. O estilo intelectual da pessoa aberta pode servir bem a um professor, mas pesquisas t&ecirc;m demonstrado que o pensamento fechado est&aacute; relacionado a um desempenho superior nos trabalhos de policial, vendas e uma variedade de ocupa&ccedil;&otilde;es de servi&ccedil;o.',
